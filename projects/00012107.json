The programme also developed market-based institutions and instruments to attract new players in the renewable energy industries and increase investments in RETs.  In order to boost and strengthen national RET markets, the UNDP/GEF programme was designed to remove major barriers to RET market development including insufficient demand, low rates of return on investment, high degree of investment risk, and insufficient knowledge and experience of policy makers, and private sector professionals.", "donor_short": [], "expenditure": [610.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [], "operating_unit": "China", "budget": 610.0, "iati_op_id": "CN", "inst_descr": "", "start": "1999-03-01", "operating_unit_id": "CHN", "expenditure": 610.0, "document_name": [[], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/CHN/00012107/PRODOC.pdf"], ["format"]], "project_id": "00012107", "inst_type_id": "", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.org.cn/", "project_title": "capacity building for renewable energy"}
