To this end, the relevant laws, regulations, instructions and guidelines will be amended, or entirely revised, including the introduction of a court appeal mechanism. A property tax information system will be developed, including a requisite supporting information technology system. Necessary computer hardware will be provided. All relevant organizational, administrative and operational changes will be introduced and made functional. Extensive training and preparation of the staff will take place to enable them to work under a modern, computerized property tax system. To improve people's tax payment compliance, a public awareness campaign will be carried out. A number of activities yielding immediate effects in terms of lowered costs, increased revenue collection, better services and higher quality work will also be carried out to motivate staff and prepare them for changes. At the end of the project, property tax collection is estimated to have increased by approximately US$ 7.5 million annually.", "donor_short": ["UNDP"], "expenditure": [101.0], "crs_descr": "Government administration", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00075608", "output_locID": "00075608-1", "name": "Amman", "focus_area": "2", "lat": "31.955220", "type": "PPLC", "awardID": "00013202", "lon": "35.945030", "precision": "1", "focus_area_descr": "Democratic Governance"}], "operating_unit": "Jordan", "budget": 2134446.0, "iati_op_id": "JO", "inst_descr": "National Execution", "start": "2003-04-01", "operating_unit_id": "JOR", "expenditure": 996093.0, "document_name": [["00013202_property tax Prodoc"], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/JOR/00013202_property tax Prodoc.pdf"], ["pdf"]], "project_id": "00013202", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.jo.undp.org/", "project_title": "building the capacity of property tax management"}
