The NEEP involves supporting energy auditing in the industrial and commercial sectors, utility load management, setting policies and regulations for residential buildings and energy-consuming appliances efficiency, improving energy efficiency information exchange, promoting energy services and private sector investments and utilization of efficient technologies. It will enhance and encourage outreach and awareness building initiatives on energy efficiency through campaigns, workshops and capacity building.", "donor_short": ["SAU"], "expenditure": [341655.0, 438679.0, 189706.0, -2838.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00014707", "output_locID": "00014707-1", "name": "Saudi Arabia", "focus_area": "5", "lat": "25", "type": "PCL", "awardID": "00014707", "lon": "45", "precision": "9", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "operating_unit": "Saudi Arabia", "budget": 1242756.0, "iati_op_id": "SA", "inst_descr": "", "start": "2003-04-30", "operating_unit_id": "SAU", "expenditure": 967202.0, "document_name": [["024 Final NEEP prodoc includ LoA - AMH - 26 Jan 2003.doc", "032 Signed Cover Page of PD - AMD - 9 Mar 2003.pdf"], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/SAU/00014707/024 Final NEEP prodoc includ LoA - AMH - 26 Jan 2003.doc", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/SAU/00014707/032 Signed Cover Page of PD - AMD - 9 Mar 2003.pdf"], ["format", "format"]], "project_id": "00014707", "inst_type_id": "", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.org.sa/sa/", "project_title": "national energy efficiency programme"}
