A number of amendments were affected to the Constitution in 2003 to help enable a further separation of responsibility between the legislative, executive and judiciary branches.\nUNDP has been a strong partner of the National Assembly for several years, with a series of projects that have helped strengthen the Assembly with regard to the legislative process and oversight function. This project represents the next step in this collaboration. While building on the achievements of the past, it also takes a longer-term strategic look at the areas of assistance needed to help the National Assemble implement its constitutional mandate.\nKey objectives of this programme will be as follows:\n\u2022 Enhanced lawmaking skills and improved procedures in legislative functions;\n\u2022 A strengthened Committee stems with clear guidelines and increased capacity of members of the oversight;\n\u2022 More effective representation of constituents through improved knowledge of parliamentarians about specific policy issues as well as areas such as the MDGs gender equality and prevention of HIV/AIDS;\n\u2022 Strengthened human resource base at the National Assembly secretariat; and \n\u2022 Rationalized complaints procedures at the National Assemble.", "donor_short": ["UNDP", "EU"], "expenditure": [-3730.0], "crs_descr": "Sectors Not Specified", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [], "operating_unit": "Lao People's Democratic Republ", "budget": 0.0, "iati_op_id": "LA", "inst_descr": "National Execution", "start": "2004-10-01", "operating_unit_id": "LAO", "expenditure": -3730.0, "document_name": [], "project_id": "00036701", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undplao.org/", "project_title": "na phase ii: strengthening national assembly"}
