Significant Climate Change benefits will be incurred through carbon emission avoidance and increased carbon capture - the former through reduction of deforestation rates and increased efficiency of transformation and final end-use of Caatinga biomass, and the latter through reforestation of degraded lands. Biodiversity benefits will be achieved through supporting actions to enhance ecosystem integrity and conservation at the landscape level establishing ecological corridors between key existing protected areas using different management tools. Project actions will also produce critical watershed conservation in a drought prone area, halting land degradation and the advance of desertification.", "donor_short": [], "expenditure": [5313.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [], "operating_unit": "Brazil", "budget": 0.0, "iati_op_id": "BR", "inst_descr": "National Execution", "start": "2004-01-02", "operating_unit_id": "BRA", "expenditure": 5313.0, "document_name": [[], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BRA/00037166/Caatinga Annex 2F Co-Financing Ltrs.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BRA/00037166/BRA02G31 Caatinga PRODOC RBLAC 13.Oct.03.doc", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BRA/00037166/Caatinga Prodoc Annexes 13Oct2003.zip"], ["format", "format", "format"]], "project_id": "00037166", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.pnud.org.br/", "project_title": "bra02g31 demonstrations of integrated ecosystem caatinga"}
