The project also seeks to demonstrate and record the many benefits as well as the efficacy of a modal shift to NMT with a view not only to increasing the modal share of NMT in Gaborone, but also to widely disseminating the lessons and encouraging the replication of the project across cities and towns of Botswana and the region.", "donor_short": ["GEFTrustee"], "expenditure": [16541.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00041288", "output_locID": "00041288-1", "name": "Gaborone", "focus_area": "-", "lat": "-24.65451", "type": "PPLC", "awardID": "00037688", "lon": "25.90859", "precision": "3", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "operating_unit": "Botswana", "budget": 16545.0, "iati_op_id": "BW", "inst_descr": "National Execution", "start": "2005-01-01", "operating_unit_id": "BWA", "expenditure": 16541.0, "document_name": [[], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BWA/00037688/GEF CC Mitigation Tracking Tool (28.06.12).xls", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BWA/00037688/BotswanaNMTManagementResponseTerminalEvaluation(28 06 2012) (01)ERReview03072012.doc", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BWA/00037688/NMT 2012 AWP signed.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BWA/00037688/Approved prodoc Botswana NMT2841.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BWA/00037688/Final Evaluation Report 6 March_NMT Botswana.pdf"], ["format", "format", "format", "format", "format"]], "project_id": "00037688", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.unbotswana.org.bw/", "project_title": "non-motorized transport facilities in gaborone city of"}
