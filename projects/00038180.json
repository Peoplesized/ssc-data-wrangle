The proposed project will establish the desired environment for a long-term market development and set a target for a follow-up BIPV program in the 10th Malaysia Plan. The project will achieve its objectives by: developing and implementing strong financing mechanisms, solid institutional and policy frameworks; extensive education and capacity building campaigns to generate awareness and\nimprove local competency; introduction of standards and guidelines, developing and enhancing the market; and upgrading the local industry towards local manufacturing.", "donor_short": ["GEFTrustee"], "expenditure": [46166.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00042090", "output_locID": "00042090-1", "name": "Malaysia", "focus_area": "-", "lat": "2.5", "type": "PCL", "awardID": "00038180", "lon": "112.5", "precision": "9", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "operating_unit": "Malaysia", "budget": 49845.0, "iati_op_id": "MY", "inst_descr": "National Execution", "start": "2005-01-06", "operating_unit_id": "MYS", "expenditure": 46166.0, "document_name": [[], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/MYS/00038180/MBIPV-ProDoc final -Main251004.doc"], ["format"]], "project_id": "00038180", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.org.my/", "project_title": "e&e: pims 2754  cc fp: building integrated photovoltaic"}
