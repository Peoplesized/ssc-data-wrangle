This will be done through a country-driven consultative process,  that takes into account Solomon Islands' obligations under the three global conventions on biodiversity, climate change and desertification/land degradation. The assessment will provide national decision-makers and funding agencies with essential information about Solomon Islands' specific capacity needs to meet its international environmental obligations. The resulting document will identify prioritized national capacity needs, a resources mobilization strategy and a capacity development action plan to guide further actions for the strengthening of national capacity.", "donor_short": ["GEFTrustee"], "expenditure": [0.0], "crs_descr": "Sectors Not Specified", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [], "operating_unit": "Fiji", "budget": 1.0, "iati_op_id": "FJ", "inst_descr": "National Execution", "start": "2005-03-01", "operating_unit_id": "FJI", "expenditure": 0.0, "document_name": [], "project_id": "00039081", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.org.fj/", "project_title": "pims 2640 nc ea: national capacity self assessment"}
