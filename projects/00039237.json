To achieve this target as per the agreement between the Ministry of Environment and the Executive Committee of Montreal Protocol, a combination of investment, training, technical support and institutional support activities had been developed. The National Phase-out Management Plan for CFCs enabled Lebanon to comply with the Montreal Protocol control schedule milestones of achieving 50% of the baseline consumption by 2005 and 15% of the baseline consumption by 2007. Complete phase-out is proposed to be achieved by end of 2009. The project had been implemented through five annual implementation programs with annual targets for CFC consumption and phase-out.\nNPMP will cover the technology conversions in the Aerosols, Foams and Refrigeration Sectors and also ensure timely, sustainable and cost-effective phase-out through a combination of investment, technical support, training and institutional support component.", "donor_short": [], "expenditure": [5856.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [], "operating_unit": "Lebanon", "budget": 6256.0, "iati_op_id": "LB", "inst_descr": "Ministry Of Environment", "start": "2005-04-01", "operating_unit_id": "LBN", "expenditure": 5856.0, "document_name": [[], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/LBN/00039237/00043946 NPMP Project Document.pdf"], ["format"]], "project_id": "00039237", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.org.lb/", "project_title": "phasing out cfcs"}
