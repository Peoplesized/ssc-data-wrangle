It also aims to assist the newly graduated youths to upgrade their skills and be prepared for regional markets, in order to increase local employment opportunities. This will address the government's objective and priority in development of the region through inviting more investments which needs trained and competent human resources locally to support their operations. This also ultimately will contribute to the government's goal of poverty eradication in the region. \r\nThis objective will be achieved by professional trainings tailored according to the market needs and the students' specialties.

In Der ez Zor and Hassakeh Governorates, respectively 30% and 7% of wells have gone out of service during the past four years. Inhabitants of many villages depend on water trucking\r\n\r\nGiven the above context, the rehabilitation of Roman Wells in the North Eastern region will strongly contribute to achieving the access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation.  Hence ensuring access to clean water resources will improve the living hand health standards, and decrease internal migration, in the North Eastern region through increased access to safe drinking water and will help reduce the severe diarrhea cases resulted from drought and lack of water.\r\n  \r\nAs North eastern region is one of the poorest regions, hence it is considered as one of the priority development areas by the national authoritiesnt for poverty reduction efforts; hence this project is fully in line with national priorities and the UN efforts for complementing governmental efforts to assist people affected by drought.   \r\n\r\nThe rehabilitation of wells in the Eastern Region will increase the quality and availability of water for the households in the least developed part of Syria, or more than 1000 residents (direct beneficiaries), with a higher indirect benefit to the non-residents of the whole area.   \r\n\r\nBased on UNDP survey, there are approximately 129 wells in Der ez Zor Governorate only and over 200 wells in the 3 governorates.  UNDP has already rehabilitated   35 wells and UNDP now is working on restoring another 9 wells in Deir Ez zour governorate. \r\nThis project aims at rehabilitating ancient Roman Wells in the north eastern region in one of the poorest regions of the country, , for use as a sustainable water source by the local population, without incurring environmental damages.  This is expected to increase the access of the local population in the north eastern region to safe drinking water.", "donor_short": ["SYR-AECI", "RAQQA-CCI"], "expenditure": [7593.0], "crs_descr": "Economic and development policy/planning", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00047566", "output_locID": "00047566-1", "name": "Syrian Arab Republic", "focus_area": "-", "lat": "35.000000", "type": "PCLI", "awardID": "00040885", "lon": "38.000000", "precision": "1", "focus_area_descr": "-"}, {"outputID": "00085114", "output_locID": "00085114-1", "name": "Syrian Arab Republic", "focus_area": "-", "lat": "35.000000", "type": "PCLI", "awardID": "00040885", "lon": "38.000000", "precision": "1", "focus_area_descr": "-"}, {"outputID": "00055188", "output_locID": "00055188-1", "name": "Syria", "focus_area": "-", "lat": "35", "type": "PCL", "awardID": "00040885", "lon": "38", "precision": "9", "focus_area_descr": "-"}, {"outputID": "00070897", "output_locID": "00070897-1", "name": "Syria", "focus_area": "-", "lat": "35", "type": "PCL", "awardID": "00040885", "lon": "38", "precision": "9", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "operating_unit": "Syria", "budget": 447304.0, "iati_op_id": "SY", "inst_descr": "The State Planning Commission", "start": "2005-01-01", "operating_unit_id": "SYR", "expenditure": 42262.0, "document_name": [["00040885_sme"], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/SYR/00040885_sme.pdf"], ["pdf"]], "project_id": "00040885", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.org.sy/", "project_title": "support for bus. innovation and dev. center in der ezzor"}
