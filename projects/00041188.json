The SEP project has been a continuation of UNDP longer term support and has built the foundation for other areas of assistance including providing the ICT base for PERP- the flagship project that registered more than 81 million people in a span of just 11 months. In addition, in order to sustain the electoral reform undertaken, UNDP is also administrating the project 'Construction of Server Stations for Electoral Database (CSSED)' to build server stations nationwide. UNDP has also continued to provide policy advisory support to the BEC, providing assistance to complete the photo voter list act, delimitation act, the candidates and results declaration rules, and supporting the BEC to complete an organisational review to provide recommendation. \r\nWith the completion of SEP project in June 2010 and the PERP project in December 2010, the preparatory assistance (PA) is designed to enable the development of  UNDP's next phase of electoral reform programming.
