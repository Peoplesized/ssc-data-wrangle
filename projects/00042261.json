This will be archived through the demonstration of this approach at four wetland reserves in the Polesie lowland, which is a unique biogeographical area spanning southern Belarus, Northern Ukraine and parts of Poland and Russia. These demonstrations will lead to the development of policies, tools, and methodologies, and these will be institutionalized within the ongoing planning and policy framework of key government bodies.\nIn order to secure biodiversity values of wetland reserves and reduce threats emanating from unsustainable land use practices, the project approach will be twofold: (1)the project will build up management effectiveness and capacities at the reserves, and (2) it will also help realigning land use regulations and practices in and around wetland protected areas towards conservation-oriented and sustainable land use. In doing so, the project will work with national and regional decision-makers, land users and local communities, as well as counterparts in Ukraine. Finally, the project will develop and implement a viable replication strategy. By demonstrating the feasibility of integrating biodiversity consideration and economic activities in Polesie reserves, Government of Belarus will be able to strengthen the overall system, 60-75% of which consists of protected areas facing similar challenges.", "donor_short": ["GEFTrustee"], "expenditure": [28586.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [], "operating_unit": "Belarus, Republic of", "budget": 15324.0, "iati_op_id": "BY", "inst_descr": "MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT", "start": "2006-02-01", "operating_unit_id": "BLR", "expenditure": 28586.0, "document_name": [["UNDP/GEF  Catalyzing of the weatland protected area system in Belarusian Polesie through increased management efficiency and realigned land use practices final evaluation"], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BLR/00042261/48429_Annual_Project_Review_24.05.2006-17.04.2011.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BLR/00042261/48429_Annual_Project_Review_2010.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BLR/00042261/48429_Annual_Project_Review_2011.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BLR/00042261/48429_Annual_Project_Review_24.05-31.12.2006.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BLR/00042261/48429_Annual_Project_Review_2009.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BLR/00042261/2894_Belarus_Polesie_ProDoc_FINAL_post_LPAC_DOA.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BLR/00042261/poles10.JPG", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BLR/00042261/ph01 097.jpg", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BLR/00042261/pic 118.jpg", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BLR/00042261/IMG_8910.jpg", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BLR/00042261/polesie 085.jpg", "http://erc.undp.org/evaluationadmin/manageevaluation/viewevaluationdetail.htmlevalid=5507"], ["format", "format", "format", "format", "format", "format", "format", "format", "format", "format", "format", "format"]], "project_id": "00042261", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://undp.by/en/", "project_title": "sustainability of belarusian polesie"}
