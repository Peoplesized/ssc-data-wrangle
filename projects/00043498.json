The project will support local authorities and state enterprises efforts to identify energy efficiency opportunities and increase internal investments to realize such opportunities in the DH&CHP sector, including the utilization of concessional financing opportunities being offered by central government. The project team will assess opportunities of local bank loans for energy efficiency investments projects. In addition to building awareness the project plans to create momentum amongst local government for investment  in energy efficiency by designing and testing employee bonuses for realizing energy efficiency and institutional incentives by enabling municipalities to retain a part of the saving they make from energy efficiency improvements.", "donor_short": ["GEFTrustee"], "expenditure": [49972.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [], "operating_unit": "Belarus, Republic of", "budget": 39113.0, "iati_op_id": "BY", "inst_descr": "STATE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY EFFI", "start": "2007-01-01", "operating_unit_id": "BLR", "expenditure": 49972.0, "document_name": [[], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BLR/00043498/2426_Belarus_EE_ProDoc_FINAL_post_LPAC_DOA_ENG.docx", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BLR/00043498/50819_Project_Document_Substantive_Revision_2010.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BLR/00043498/50819_APR_2009.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BLR/00043498/50819_APR-2010_17.01.2011.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BLR/00043498/50819_APR-2011_20.02.2012.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BLR/00043498/50819_APR_2007.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BLR/00043498/50819_APR_2008.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BLR/00043498/IMG_0465.jpg", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BLR/00043498/IMG_7210.jpg", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BLR/00043498/IMG_7293.jpg"], ["format", "format", "format", "format", "format", "format", "format", "format", "format", "format"]], "project_id": "00043498", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://undp.by/en/", "project_title": "energy efficiency in state sector in belarus"}
