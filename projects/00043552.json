Decentralization offers the window of opportunity to define the clear DRM mandate for Aiyl-Okmoty and establish mechanism to support DRM as the critical component of their social and economical  development. The programme will therefore engage with the decentralization process and cover the practical application, testing and refinement of DRM  instruments and appropriate technologies at the local level as well as the normative work at the national level. The two national implementing partners are Ministry of emergency situation as the national lead agency in DRM and the National Agency for Local self-governance as the national lead agency in supporting the decentralization process.", "donor_short": ["UNDP", "WFP", "DEN", "EU"], "expenditure": [2151.0], "crs_descr": "Sectors Not Specified", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [], "operating_unit": "Kyrgyzstan", "budget": 0.0, "iati_op_id": "KG", "inst_descr": "GOVERNMENT", "start": "2006-01-01", "operating_unit_id": "KGZ", "expenditure": 2151.0, "document_name": [[], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/KGZ/00043552/00062634_DRMP_Prodoc_2008-2010.pdf"], ["format"]], "project_id": "00043552", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.kg/", "project_title": "disaster risk management in decentralization"}
