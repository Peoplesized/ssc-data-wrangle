These tools will be developed and disseminated for broader application to Strategic Priority #2 on Mainstreaming Biodiversity in Production Landscapes and Sectors. The project will complement efforts to promote sustainable forest management. Although the tools it generates will be developed in a Malaysian context, they will be applicable to forests throughout Southeast Asia and in other tropical countries. To ensure that the global benefits of the research are maximized, the project will include a variety of training and dissemination activities. This is relevant to GEF's Strategic Priority Area IV on Generation and dissemination of Best Practices for addressing current and emerging biodiversity issues.", "donor_short": ["GEFTrustee"], "expenditure": [371463.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00051228", "output_locID": "00051228-1", "name": "Kuala Lumpur", "focus_area": "-", "lat": "3.1412", "type": "PPLC", "awardID": "00043796", "lon": "101.68653", "precision": "3", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "operating_unit": "Malaysia", "budget": 403968.0, "iati_op_id": "MY", "inst_descr": "National Execution", "start": "2006-10-01", "operating_unit_id": "MYS", "expenditure": 371463.0, "document_name": [[], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/MYS/00043796/1370 MAL CBIOD prodoc signature page.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/MYS/00043796/UNDP-GEF Project Document for CBIOD V9.pdf"], ["format", "format"]], "project_id": "00043796", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.org.my/", "project_title": "e&e: pims 1370 full bd:  forest planng tools"}
