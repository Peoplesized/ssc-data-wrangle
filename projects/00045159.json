The prevention approaches are based on harm reduction principles, including community outreach, peer based education, diversified drug treatment services, fighting stigma and discrimination and condom distribution and promotion.  In order to develop a productive, responsible, and ever-improving program, a system of Monitoring and Evaluation will be strengthened.\nAs the main goal of the project is to prevent the spread of HIV focusing on vulnerable groups; increase survival rates of PLWHA one year after diagnosis from 25% to 90% by establishing VCT services and referral system and to decrease stigma and discrimination against PLWHA and people under increased risk of infection, the overall strategy envisions localizing prevention and increasing access to good quality services tailored to the needs of vulnerable populations. \n\nIt seeks to strengthen and scale up existing services to ensure country wide coverage of effective services. Due to the fragmented health system considerable inequities in service availability exist and this program will promote harmonized approaches and policies, where MoH F BiH and MoH RS will have leading role. The prevention approaches will be based on harm reduction principles, including community outreach, peer based education, diversified drug treatment services, fighting stigma and discrimination and condom distribution and promotion.\nAlso, VCT services will be further strengthened and established where not available. Testing referral and promotion will be developed through coordination of all involved stakeholders, to ensure early case identification. Treatment, including AVR and prevention of opportunistic infections is already provided to all patients in BiH free of charge by the MoHs in accordance with best clinical practices. \nSynergies of this project implementation with the work of MoHs lie in the creation of referencing and cross-referencing systems within the structure of BiH health care system, a practice that can be enormously beneficial. It is expected that the project implementation will positively influence HIV/AIDS epidemiology as synergies will be created between NGO outreach and epidemiological surveillance in creating a sentinel surveillance system that will improve grassroots outreach, and vice versa.", "donor_short": ["GFATM"], "expenditure": [24242.0], "crs_descr": "Sectors Not Specified", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00076387", "output_locID": "00076387-1", "name": "Bosnia and Herzegovina", "focus_area": "3", "lat": "44.250000", "type": "PCLI", "awardID": "00045159", "lon": "17.833330", "precision": "1", "focus_area_descr": "Responsive Institutions"}, {"outputID": "00076377", "output_locID": "00076377-1", "name": "Bosnia and Herzegovina", "focus_area": "3", "lat": "44.250000", "type": "PCLI", "awardID": "00045159", "lon": "17.833330", "precision": "1", "focus_area_descr": "Responsive Institutions"}], "operating_unit": "Bosnia and Herzegovina", "budget": 44278054.0, "iati_op_id": "BA", "inst_descr": "UNDP", "start": "2006-11-01", "operating_unit_id": "BIH", "expenditure": 18084056.0, "document_name": [["Project Document", "00045159_ProDoc ENG - part 1", "00045159_ProDoc ENG - part 2", "00045159_ProDoc ENG - part 3", "00045159_ProDoc Phase I", "00045159_ProDoc Phase II 1.Part", "00045159_ProDoc Phase II 2.Part", "00045159_Signed first page - Eng"], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BIH/00045159_DOTS ProDoc Engl.docx", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BIH/00045159_ProDoc ENG - part 1.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BIH/00045159_ProDoc ENG - part 2.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BIH/00045159_ProDoc ENG - part 3.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BIH/00045159_ProDoc Phase I.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BIH/00045159_ProDoc Phase II 1.Part.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BIH/00045159_ProDoc Phase II 2.Part.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BIH/00045159_Signed first page - Eng.pdf"], ["doc", "pdf", "pdf", "pdf", "pdf", "pdf", "pdf", "pdf"]], "project_id": "00045159", "inst_type_id": "40", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.ba.undp.org/", "project_title": "national response to hiv/aids and tuberculosis in bih"}
