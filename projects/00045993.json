The project aimed at enhancing technical and institutional capacity of the country to mainstream Climate Change concerns in national development planning and policies by enabling Swaziland to prepare and submit its SNC to the UNFCCC and meet its Convention obligations. This would facilitate presentation of the information in a consistent, transparent and comparable manner taking into account specific national circumstances.  The main components of the project are: (a) description of national circumstances, (b) national inventory of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) and sinks, (c) assessment of vulnerability and planning of adaptation stages I and II, (d) mitigation of GHGs, (e) capacity building to assess technology needs, modalities to absorb them and host projects. The project also aims to enhance public awareness and knowledge on CC related issues in Swaziland and strengthen the ability of Swaziland to participate in different mechanisms directed to abate the GHG emissions from its territory and to fulfill other commitments to the UNFCC.", "donor_short": ["GEFTrustee"], "expenditure": [18446.0], "crs_descr": "Sectors Not Specified", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00054505", "output_locID": "00054505-1", "name": "Swaziland", "focus_area": "-", "lat": "-26.5", "type": "PCL", "awardID": "00045993", "lon": "31.5", "precision": "9", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "operating_unit": "Swaziland", "budget": 22188.0, "iati_op_id": "SZ", "inst_descr": "National Execution", "start": "2007-01-09", "operating_unit_id": "SWZ", "expenditure": 18446.0, "document_name": [], "project_id": "00045993", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.org.sz/", "project_title": "gef pims 3352 swazi msp swaziland's snc."}
