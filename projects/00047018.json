While some outputs focus on specific sub-regions, the project generally addresses the whole region. Firstly, fiscal decentralization frameworks in the region will be strengthened. Secondly, local governance will be supported through the development of Human Resource Management at the local level. Thirdly, statistical literacy and capacity of local governments to gather, analyze and use disaggregated data and introduce MDG-based participatory planning and budgeting will be strengthened. Inclusive decision making that includes participatory planning and review processes will be facilitated as an essential measure of effective leadership for the MDGs. Finally, local government associations in Central Asia and Caucasus will be supported to fulfill functions of advocacy, coordination and political participation. These priority areas will allow local governments in the region to further develop their ability to address the development challenges and ensure effective local development.", "donor_short": [], "expenditure": [50656.0], "crs_descr": "Government administration", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [], "operating_unit": null, "budget": 50665.0, "iati_op_id": "998", "inst_descr": "UNDP", "start": "2007-04-13", "operating_unit_id": null, "expenditure": 50656.0, "document_name": [[], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/SVK/00047018/Regional_project_document_2007_final_local_governments.rtf"], ["format"]], "project_id": "00047018", "inst_type_id": "40", "operating_unit_website": null, "project_title": "strengthening capacities of local governments"}
