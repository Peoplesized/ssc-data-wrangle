The Government is committed to fight the disease and increasingly allocate financial, human and infrastructural resources for this purpose. However, due to the continuing economic constraints, substantial funding and programmatic gaps exist; it has been therefore decided to solicit support from the Global Fund in Round 6. This support will contribute to the consolidation of the national TB control programme through sustaining universal coverage and improving quality of DOTS interventions and expanding the DOTS framework in line with the new WHO Stop TB Strategy and the Global Plan to Stop TB 2006-2015.", "donor_short": [], "expenditure": [-493.0], "crs_descr": "STD control including HIV/AIDS", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [], "operating_unit": "Tajikistan", "budget": 0.0, "iati_op_id": "TJ", "inst_descr": "UNDP", "start": "2007-06-18", "operating_unit_id": "TJK", "expenditure": -493.0, "document_name": [[], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/TJK/00047513/2009 AWP Round 6 TB.pdf"], ["format"]], "project_id": "00047513", "inst_type_id": "40", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.tj/site/", "project_title": "expanding and strengthening dots in tajikistan"}
