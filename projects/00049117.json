This will be achieved by the construction of stone walls, check dams and water collection reservoirs to prevent runoff water from reaching villages and farms along the Assi river and through the restoration of land cover to reduce soil erosion. The project will also work on land cover improvement to reduce soil erosion through reforestation and pasture rehabilitation in the target area.
