The project is consistent with UNDP's Strategic Plan and the Regional Programme for Africa, 2008-2011, both of which accord priority for effective capacity development for pro-poor growth and MDGs. An important element of the project strategy is to facilitate in the short-run access to the best expertise in the field, collaborate closely with international and regional partners engaged primarily in the governance part of the value chain, while preparing the ground for sustained long-term capacity development in the targeted areas in the countries. Close linkages will also be actively built with similar regional and global initiatives within outside UNDP.", "donor_short": [], "expenditure": [1139988.0], "crs_descr": "Economic and development policy/planning", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [], "operating_unit": null, "budget": 1294055.0, "iati_op_id": "998", "inst_descr": "UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PRO", "start": "2008-05-16", "operating_unit_id": null, "expenditure": 1139988.0, "document_name": [], "project_id": "00050087", "inst_type_id": "40", "operating_unit_website": "http://web.undp.org/africa/", "project_title": "raf08006- cd-negotiating & regulating investmt contracts"}
