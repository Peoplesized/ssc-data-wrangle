Industries and Governments in developing countries will also benefit from a better understanding of the potential implications of the global HCFC demand and supply scenario. Inter-linkages with other conventions will also be looked particularly in relation to HCFC's having a comparatively high global warming potential. The project will also assess the potential for synergies in the management of HCFC phase out and the management of other chemicals (i.e. related to other ozone depleting substances, HFCs, POPs etc).", "donor_short": ["GEFTrustee"], "expenditure": [100563.0, 2104.0, 16047.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00062098", "output_locID": "00062098-1", "name": "Slovakia", "focus_area": "5", "lat": "48.66667", "type": "PCL", "awardID": "00050308", "lon": "19.5", "precision": "9", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "operating_unit": "Bratislava Regional Center", "budget": 44826.0, "iati_op_id": "998", "inst_descr": "UNDP", "start": "2008-06-19", "operating_unit_id": "SVK", "expenditure": 118714.0, "document_name": [["HCFC_regional_MSP_UNDP_project_document.doc"], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/SVK/00050308/HCFC_regional_MSP_UNDP_project_document.doc"], ["format"]], "project_id": "00050308", "inst_type_id": "40", "operating_unit_website": null, "project_title": "pims 3597 ozone - preparing for hcfc phase out"}
