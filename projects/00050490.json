As part of a general objective of developing legal empowerment for the poorest and most vulnerable groups, it seems of great importance to develop knowledge of customary laws and practices throughout the country in order to efficiently combine this source of law with the broader official normative framework. This should ultimately lead to a better understanding and harmonization of customary legal practices as well as an improved access to justice and information for villagers living in out-of-reach places. It should also promote gender equality as well as an enhanced and equitable application of international Human Rights standards based on the international treaties the Lao PDR ratified.\n\nOutputs:\n\nOutput 1: Relevant database on customary laws and practices in Lao PDR created\n\nOutput 2: Formulation of a draft National Strategy on customary law based on the survey previously carried out and resulting database\"", "donor_short": ["UNDP"], "expenditure": [-482.0], "crs_descr": "Sectors Not Specified", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00073451", "output_locID": "00073451-1", "name": "Vientiane", "focus_area": "3", "lat": "17.966670", "type": "PPLC", "awardID": "00050490", "lon": "102.600000", "precision": "1", "focus_area_descr": "Responsive Institutions"}, {"outputID": "00070144", "output_locID": "00070144-1", "name": "Vientiane", "focus_area": "-", "lat": "17.96667", "type": "PPLC", "awardID": "00050490", "lon": "102.6", "precision": "3", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "operating_unit": "Lao People's Democratic Republ", "budget": 826504.0, "iati_op_id": "LA", "inst_descr": "National Execution", "start": "2008-09-01", "operating_unit_id": "LAO", "expenditure": 836392.0, "document_name": [["00050490_2009  LSMP AWP", "00050490_2009 AWP-Iniation Plan", "00050490_2009-04_LaoPDR_Customary Law_Signed_Prodoc", "00050490_2010-01_TERMINAL_REPORT_LSMP", "00050490_2010-08-10_Customary_Law_PBM", "00050490_2011-01-24_Transfer of assets_CL_UNDP to Project", "00050490_Customary Law_ APR2009", "00050490_Customary Law_AWP_2010", "00050490_LPAC Minutes Customary Law project", "00050490_Signed AWP extension", "00050490_SIGNED LPAC MINUTES 01.01.08", "00050490_SIGNED LSMP INITIATION PLAN 01.09.08"], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/LAO/00050490_2009  LSMP AWP.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/LAO/00050490_2009 AWP-Iniation Plan.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/LAO/00050490_2009-04_LaoPDR_Customary Law_Signed_Prodoc.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/LAO/00050490_2010-01_TERMINAL_REPORT_LSMP.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/LAO/00050490_2010-08-10_Customary_Law_PBM.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/LAO/00050490_2011-01-24_Transfer of assets_CL_UNDP to Project.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/LAO/00050490_Customary Law_ APR2009.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/LAO/00050490_Customary Law_AWP_2010.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/LAO/00050490_LPAC Minutes Customary Law project.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/LAO/00050490_Signed AWP extension.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/LAO/00050490_SIGNED LPAC MINUTES 01.01.08.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/LAO/00050490_SIGNED LSMP INITIATION PLAN 01.09.08.pdf"], ["pdf", "pdf", "pdf", "pdf", "pdf", "pdf", "pdf", "pdf", "pdf", "pdf", "pdf", "pdf"]], "project_id": "00050490", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.la.undp.org", "project_title": "lsmp: support to implementation of legalsectormasterplan"}
