The multitude of legislation and associated responsible departments will be rationalized in terms of cost-effectiveness and attainment of immediate objectives, such as the development and implementation of co-managed projects among multiple departments that produce synergies.  Both government and non-state stakeholders will be better enabled to undertake activities that are mutually supportive of each other, including co-managed projects (such as integrated resource management projects).", "donor_short": [], "expenditure": [76953.0], "crs_descr": "Sectors Not Specified", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [], "operating_unit": "Belize", "budget": 77553.0, "iati_op_id": "BZ", "inst_descr": "", "start": "2008-09-01", "operating_unit_id": "BLZ", "expenditure": 76953.0, "document_name": [[], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/BLZ/00050564/PRODOC-Strengthening-Institutional-Capacities-for-Coordinating...NCSA2_.pdf"], ["format"]], "project_id": "00050564", "inst_type_id": "", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.org.bz/", "project_title": "strengthening capacities to coordinate rio conventions"}
