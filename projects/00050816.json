The first step entails the assistance towards development of a policy framework of how regional development should be realized in Albania, the roles and interaction of various institutions and stakeholders. This includes as well as the mobilization of stronger political commitment to implement such a policy. Subsequently, the Project will provide advice to the government on functional and legislative aspects, supporting national and sub-national Regional Development structures and the organization of participatory mechanisms. Assistance will be subsequently provided to institutions engaged in Regional Development, by making use of experiences of other EU member states and/or candidate countries. The Project will also provide assistance to national statistics in order to enable the specialized national offices to improve systems and capacities in place so as to deliver GDP data at sub-national level. It will also develop and recommend to the relevant government institutions various NUTS 2 options for the country's statistical sub-division. Furthermore, the Project in a few selected regions will support the establishment of appropriate decision-making and technical structures. This will help the regions to make effective use of decentralized authority and resources to respond to citizens' priority needs that are in line with national policies and plans. In these selected regions, funding will be available to support local infrastructure, which will serve as a test for the new framework. That in the future will help in enabling the local actors to absorb IPA funding and eventually the structural funds.", "donor_short": ["UNDP", "EU"], "expenditure": [1935168.0, 592166.0, 4814826.0, -648107.0], "crs_descr": "Government administration", "focus_area_descr": "Democratic Governance"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00062935", "output_locID": "00062935-1", "name": "Berat, Albania", "focus_area": "2", "lat": "40.70583", "type": "PPLA", "awardID": "00050816", "lon": "19.95222", "precision": "3", "focus_area_descr": "Democratic Governance"}, {"outputID": "00062935", "output_locID": "00062935-2", "name": "Elbasan, Albania", "focus_area": "2", "lat": "41.1125", "type": "PPLA", "awardID": "00050816", "lon": "20.08222", "precision": "3", "focus_area_descr": "Democratic Governance"}, {"outputID": "00062935", "output_locID": "00062935-3", "name": "Kukes, Albania", "focus_area": "2", "lat": "42.07694", "type": "PPLA", "awardID": "00050816", "lon": "20.42194", "precision": "3", "focus_area_descr": "Democratic Governance"}, {"outputID": "00062935", "output_locID": "00062935-4", "name": "Diber, Albania", "focus_area": "2", "lat": "41.66667", "type": "ADM1", "awardID": "00050816", "lon": "20.16667", "precision": "4", "focus_area_descr": "Democratic Governance"}], "operating_unit": "Albania", "budget": 5344342.0, "iati_op_id": "AL", "inst_descr": "UNDP", "start": "2008-09-09", "operating_unit_id": "ALB", "expenditure": 6694053.0, "document_name": [["62935 Integrated Support ot Decentralization Prodoc.pdf"], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/ALB/00050816/62935 Integrated Support ot Decentralization Prodoc.pdf"], ["format"]], "project_id": "00050816", "inst_type_id": "40", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.org.al/", "project_title": "integrated support for decentralization"}
