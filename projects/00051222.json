The project calls for:    \n\uf0a7\tCollaboration by the three lead organizations for CADRI to support Resident Coordinators (RCs) and Heads of UN agencies to lead the incorporation of  recovery and disaster risk reduction into country level preparedness and programming processes, \n\uf0a7\tPilot demonstrations with UN/Humanitarian Country Teams (UNCTs) in up to five regions for disaster preparedness planning, for both response and for recovery.  The results of the pilot are expected to generate  a) a model approach that can be extended in the regions for UN system  preparedness planning that addresses response,  recovery and development, b) a more unified approach to preparedness planning by OCHA, BCPR and ISDR, d) UNCTs disaster planning is framed in the full spectrum of disaster risk issues. \n\uf0a7\tPilot demonstrations in two countries for capacity development planning for preparedness, including recovery. The results of this pilot will a) increase \"know-how\" on how to develop gendersensitive capacity development strategies for preparedness,  for response and for recovery, and b) increase access to tools and services for capacity development planning for ISDR system members,  c) support a harmonized approach to recovery preparedness on the part of governments and the UNCT.   \n\uf0a7\tSupport to CADRI to augment its own service delivery capacity. \n\uf0a7\tContinued support to the Disaster Reduction Team to implement its learning strategy.   \nThe work will be undertaken over a four-year period, 2009-2012.
