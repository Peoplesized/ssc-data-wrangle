Improved livelihoods through generation of income and employment opportunities\r\n2. Improve social and physical infrastructure using labour intensive approaches\r\n3. Advocacy and awareness geared towards curbing the effect of piracy and crimes in the target areas \r\n\r\nPROJECT BRIEF\r\nThe project addresses the urgent issue of income generation and job creation in South Central Somalia, through a community based \r\napproach, aiming to build permanent capacities and increased skills levels, while addressing direct income generation priorities \r\nfor the most affected parts of youth, women, IDP and host communities. By applying a community based approach and involving \r\nthe beneficiary communities in all phases of project implementation it is aiming for local ownership of the project works, thus \r\nenhancing the sustainability of the project. The project addresses short term income generation issues, as well as vocational \r\ntraining, grants, micro credit/revolving funds and capacity building.     In light of the unstable security situation in Somalia,   the \r\nimplementing   structure   is   designed   to   be   flexible,   both   in   terms   of   geographical   area   and   in   terms   of implementation \r\nstructures. The project aims to involve to the maximum extent local capacities, such as existing networks of Non Governmental \r\nOrganizations and contracted monitoring capacity. The project will build on existing UNDP and other initiatives and will be \r\njointly implemented by UNDP and other UN specialized agencies, whereby UNDP will assume overall management responsibility \r\nand implement some selected components, while possibly other specialized Agencies, will implement specific components, in line with \r\ntheir core competencies. Given its overall mandate to coordinate anti-piracy initiatives, the United Nations Political Office will provide technical advice to the project, particularly on the issue of piracy, and ensuring linkages to complementary initiatives. UNPOS will also provide regular political analysis to ensure project initiatives are implemented in an enabling environment.  The project implementation period will commence on 01 July 2009 and end on 31 March 2010.", "donor_short": [], "expenditure": [108478.0], "crs_descr": "Sectors Not Specified", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00079622", "output_locID": "00079622-1", "name": "Somalia", "focus_area": "6", "lat": "6.000000", "type": "PCLI", "awardID": "00056487", "lon": "48.000000", "precision": "1", "focus_area_descr": "Crisis Prevention & Recovery"}], "operating_unit": "Somalia", "budget": 913108.0, "iati_op_id": "SO", "inst_descr": "UNDP", "start": "2009-01-01", "operating_unit_id": "SOM", "expenditure": 825277.0, "document_name": [], "project_id": "00056487", "inst_type_id": "40", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.so.undp.org/", "project_title": "employment generation for early recovery project"}
