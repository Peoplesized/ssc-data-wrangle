The project aim will be achieved through the following two outputs. Firstly, significant support to the Office of the State Minister on Regional Issues will be provided to effectively lead and coordinate local governance reform process. This will encompass institutional development support to the Office of State Minister, as well as the development of policy formulation and implementation capacities within the office. Considerable efforts under this component will also be devoted to create supportive environment  for the reform process by increasing knowledge and awareness of different stakeholder groups. Secondly, the project will support the process of developing a professional, accountable and efficient local civil service, capable of exercising  the new competencies assigned in the process of local governance reform. This will be achieved through the development of a concept for sustainable/professional local government training and development system, and facilitation of the provision of priority training programmes to address the most urgent needs of local governments in the process of local governance reform.", "donor_short": [], "expenditure": [25837.0], "crs_descr": "Government administration", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [], "operating_unit": "Georgia", "budget": 26215.0, "iati_op_id": "GE", "inst_descr": "GOVERNMENT", "start": "2009-01-01", "operating_unit_id": "GEO", "expenditure": 25837.0, "document_name": [[], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/GEO/00056551/Local Governance prodoc.pdf"], ["format"]], "project_id": "00056551", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.org.ge/", "project_title": "support to the local governance reform in georgia"}
