The case for decentralization rests in part on the effective canonization of the economy arising from designation of land categories and travel limitations. Support to economic decentralization will be delivered as one element of UNDP's Local Government Support Programme, which has the objective of decentralized, efficient and inclusive local government in the oPt capable of delivering quality services. The approach to developing an economic role for local government units will initially be through experimentation, focusing on 'pilot' municipalities as a basis for models.
