In times of shrinking family networks, the idea is for multi-generational homes to be places where the mutual support of young and old is reinvented and reinvigorated. This not only creates an added value for the individual, but it helps our entire society to better meet the challenges of the future. This is because multi-generational homes overcome the isolation experienced by the different age groups and encourage mutual tolerance and support. Moreover, multigenerational homes help to nurture and educate children, advise families, activate civic commitment, provide older persons with a meaningful task and develop and broker family-based and intergenerational services.", "donor_short": ["LITHUANIA"], "expenditure": [36359.0], "crs_descr": "Economic and development policy/planning", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00070454", "output_locID": "00070454-1", "name": "Vilnius", "focus_area": "-", "lat": "54.7", "type": "PPLC", "awardID": "00057125", "lon": "25.26", "precision": "3", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "operating_unit": "Lithuania, Republic of", "budget": 49920.0, "iati_op_id": "LT", "inst_descr": "NATIONAL EXECUTION", "start": "2009-03-12", "operating_unit_id": "LTU", "expenditure": 36359.0, "document_name": [[], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/LTU/00057125/UNDPprodoc_Dienakartu_web.pdf"], ["format"]], "project_id": "00057125", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.lt/", "project_title": "a day together: multigenerational homes"}
