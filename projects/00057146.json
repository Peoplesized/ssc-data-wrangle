Pre-trial detainees are languishing in jail as a result of poor case management procedures, lack of transportation, and lack of legal representation.  It is the responsibility of the Public Defenders' Office to represent indigents, yet the office is poorly equipped to do so.  The Public Defenders' Office lacks both the logistical support and proper capacity to provide services so desperately needed by unrepresented indigents.  While much emphasis has been placed on prosecution of the accused, the defence has not been given similar consideration.  A fully functioning and just legal system should place equal emphasis on prosecution and defence and upholding the right to due process.", "donor_short": [], "expenditure": [5299.0], "crs_descr": "Legal and judicial development", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [], "operating_unit": "Liberia", "budget": 5300.0, "iati_op_id": "LR", "inst_descr": "UNDP", "start": "2009-04-01", "operating_unit_id": "LBR", "expenditure": 5299.0, "document_name": [[], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/LBR/00057146/Public Defense Project-PBF.pdf"], ["format"]], "project_id": "00057146", "inst_type_id": "40", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.lr.undp.org/", "project_title": "strengthening public defense"}
