In particular, the project will incorporate natural resource valuation tools in the implementation of the Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEA), ensuring that governmental development policies are better informed of environmental values (i.e., biodiversity conservation, environmentally sound and sustainable land management, and climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies) to national economic priorities.  Furthermore, the project will incorporate natural resource valuation tools into the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process, allowing for a more informed decision in the permitting process of development projects.  Overall, this project will strengthen the implementation of the SEA and EIA processes, facilitating greater compliance to national environmental legislation, which in turn will contribute to helping Jamaica meet its obligations under the CBD, CCD and FCCC.", "donor_short": ["UNDP", "GEFTrustee"], "expenditure": [44711.0, 104787.0, 216567.0, 32355.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00070518", "output_locID": "00070518-1", "name": "Jamaica", "focus_area": "5", "lat": "18.25", "type": "PCL", "awardID": "00057157", "lon": "-77.5", "precision": "9", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "operating_unit": "Jamaica", "budget": 464547.0, "iati_op_id": "JM", "inst_descr": "National Environment & Plannin", "start": "2009-01-01", "operating_unit_id": "JAM", "expenditure": 398420.0, "document_name": [["2010 GEF APR/PIR", "2011 Annual Progress Report", "2010 Annual Progress Report", "Piloting NRV in EIA Project document", "Piloting Natural Resource Valuation within Environmental Impact Assessments", "2009 Annual Progress Report", "2012 GEF APR/PIR", "2011GEF APR/PIR"], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/JAM/3619 NRV in EIA Jamaica- UNDP_GEF_PIR_2010_V11.xls", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/JAM/70518-NRV_2011_AnnualProgressReport.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/JAM/NRV 2010 Annual Report (00070518).pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/JAM/PRODOC_MSP_NRV in EIA (00057157).pdf", "http://erc.undp.org/evaluationadmin/manageevaluation/viewevaluationdetail.htmlevalid=3933", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/JAM/2009 Annual Report NRV (70518).pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/JAM/NRV_PIR-APR_2012.xls", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/JAM/3619_UNDP_GEF_ST_2011_V06_MFA Jamaica template (revised 8.9.11).xlsm"], ["format", "format", "format", "format", "format", "format", "format", "format"]], "project_id": "00057157", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.jm.undp.org/", "project_title": "piloting natural resource valuation in eias in jamaica"}
