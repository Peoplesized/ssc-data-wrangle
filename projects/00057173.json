Members of families at social risk, disable persons, women returning into labour market after a longer period of unemployment, women aged 50+ will be assisted to acquire or recover vocational knowledge and capacities (vocational trainings) and subsequently will be individually motivated to undertake personal efforts for (re)entering into labour market. Employees working in the project partners' organizations and falling under the definition of project beneficiaries (people aged 50+  who haven't acquired professional qualifications required in social services sector) will be also assisted to acquire social worker's or assistant's profession that will enable them to stay competitive in labour market and to keep their positions.  \r\nThe resettlement model applied in 6 economically disadvantaged municipalities will enable:\r\na) to develop and certify vocational training programmes using which project beneficiaries (people at social risks) will be trained and provided with professions in great request in social services sector. These efforts taken will subsequently lead towards increased employability rates of project beneficiaries by not less than 40 percent; \r\nb) to promote and further develop the organization and management of voluntary work in social services provision including preventive social services for families; \r\nc) to develop and expand the network of preventive social services for families in Lithuania applying the international Home-Start methodology.  \r\nDuration: 29 months\r\nTotal budget: 1 827 104 Litas", "donor_short": ["LITHUANIA"], "expenditure": [24576.0], "crs_descr": "Economic and development policy/planning", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [], "operating_unit": "Lithuania, Republic of", "budget": 24666.0, "iati_op_id": "LT", "inst_descr": "NATIONAL EXECUTION", "start": "2009-03-12", "operating_unit_id": "LTU", "expenditure": 24576.0, "document_name": [[], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/LTU/00057173/our choice prodoc web.pdf"], ["format"]], "project_id": "00057173", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.lt/", "project_title": "our choice: professions or voluntarism"}
