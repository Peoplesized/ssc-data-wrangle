The Programme targeted reconciliation and local capacity development initiatives conducive to the stability of communities, and return of the internally displaced Southerners mainly in the less developed suburbs of the Capital Beirut.\nFollowing significant progress of the programme, the July 2006 war aftermath and its severe consequences to the lives and livelihoods of the southern communities compounded poverty and development challenges by massive destruction. Immediately after the war, UNDP implemented emergency and quick impact interventions and led the UN efforts to support the recovery of the South. The massive destruction and the adverse war impact on socio economic life, is still far from being recovered even to the pre-July 2006 war.  The local economy that was hardly recovering from the long years of occupation received a massive drawback. Lives and livelihoods of the communities remain vulnerable, and in dire need for support. \nMeanwhile, and due to the ongoing political crisis, the South and its socio economic support, or lack of it, continues to provide potential for additional conflict.  Thus the continuation of UNDP's support, which has now expanded into the entire South, remains crucial.  This was further reiterated by the Government, at the last tripartite meeting held late April 2008.  \nThe project will focus on strenghtening the capacities of local governance structure, local community economic development and the reintegration and social reconciliation of youth, but also support the enhancement of coordination mechanisms and the update of  a management information system.", "donor_short": ["UNDP", "CDR"], "expenditure": [56234.0], "crs_descr": "Economic and development policy/planning", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00070566", "output_locID": "00070566-1", "name": "Beirut", "focus_area": "-", "lat": "33.88894", "type": "PPLC", "awardID": "00057193", "lon": "35.49442", "precision": "3", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "operating_unit": "Lebanon", "budget": 78643.0, "iati_op_id": "LB", "inst_descr": "Council For Development And Re", "start": "2009-04-01", "operating_unit_id": "LBN", "expenditure": 56234.0, "document_name": [[], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/LBN/00057193/00070566PD.pdf"], ["format"]], "project_id": "00057193", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.org.lb/", "project_title": "socio economic rehabilitation programme in south lebanon"}
