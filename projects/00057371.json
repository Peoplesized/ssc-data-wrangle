In Kosovo, the ability to access justice is still constrained by inadequate quantity and quality of services - government and civil society alike.  In addition, information about the availability and accessing of legal services remains limited, and services still tend to be concentrated in particular areas such as bigger towns.\nThe ultimate success of increasing access to justice remains premised on a two-sided approach, engaging both government actors as well as civil society.  The A2J project will focus on capacity building  training and expansion of services in the areas of legal assistance and information  in order to increase and / or improve services with a focus on minority groups and women.  Awareness-raising on transitional justice issues and a feasibility study on community-level priorities in the areas of legal aid and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms (including e-justice) will also form part of the activities.  In order to consolidate access to justice information and activities, UNDP will initiate regular meetings on access to justice themes for all interested actors within Kosovo including government, international organizations, civil society groups and UNDP staff.  At these meetings, UNDP will facilitate a coordinated approach to access to justice support in Kosovo. \nIn regard to access to information UNDP will act as coordinator and liaison between different actors in the field of access to information. UNDP will facilitate the capacity development of both communities/vulnerable groups that are in demand for information and the civil service and other government agencies that supply the information.\nWithin the strategic framework of the UNDP Kosovo Justice and Security Programme 2008-11, Access to Justice forms an important component in building a strong and effective justice system that all members of Kosovo society can utilize to resolve legal issues: Justice for all.", "donor_short": ["UNDP"], "expenditure": [76.0], "crs_descr": "Legal and judicial development", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00081422", "output_locID": "00081422-1", "name": "Pristina", "focus_area": "4", "lat": "42.672720", "type": "PPLC", "awardID": "00057371", "lon": "21.166880", "precision": "1", "focus_area_descr": "Gender Equality"}], "operating_unit": "Kosovo (As per UNSCR 1244)", "budget": 2263467.0, "iati_op_id": "XK", "inst_descr": "Direct Execution", "start": "2009-05-05", "operating_unit_id": null, "expenditure": 2247165.0, "document_name": [["00057371_Access to Justice project document"], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/KOS/00057371_Access to Justice project document.pdf"], ["pdf"]], "project_id": "00057371", "inst_type_id": "40", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.ks.undp.org/", "project_title": "access to justice"}
