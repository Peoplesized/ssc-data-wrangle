Coordination and accountability: Many COs are willing to engage on HIV, but they often lack the technical knowledge and network to design a relevant strategy and implementable workplan that are both effective and in line with national needs/priorities. In 2010, 3 COs (oPt, Libya and Iraq) requested that the HIV practice conduct a country mission (several others requested technical support in drafting the strategy, but did not request a country mission).  A  similar number of request for support is expected for 2011 (certain countries already sent a request, cf. Kuwait and UAE), especially for countries for which we managed to leverage PAF grants. LDP and CCE: UNDP committed to take the lead in the UN Joint Teams on AIDS to support leadership development programmes for women, young women and girls living with HIV in 30 countries by end of 2010 , and this was strongly reflected in the UNDP Administrator's speech on 2 March 2010, during the launch of the UNAIDS Agenda for Accelerated Country action for Women, Girls, Gender Equality and HIV.", "donor_short": ["UNAIDS"], "expenditure": [95979.0, -6600.0], "crs_descr": "STD control including HIV/AIDS", "focus_area_descr": "Inclusive & Sustainable Growth"}, {"output_id": "00073772", "crs": "16064", "donor_id": [""], "focus_area": "-", "gender_descr": "None", "output_title": "Arab St. (HIV Outcome 9)", "budget": [0.0], "fiscal_year": [2011], "gender_id": "0", "donor_name": ["POL-UNAIDS"], "award_id": "00059094", "output_descr": null, "donor_short": [], "expenditure": [-11150.0], "crs_descr": "Social mitigation of HIV/AIDS", "focus_area_descr": "-"}, {"output_id": "00073774", "crs": "16064", "donor_id": [""], "focus_area": "-", "gender_descr": "None", "output_title": "Arab St. (HIV Outcome 11)", "budget": [202976.0], "fiscal_year": [2011], "gender_id": "0", "donor_name": ["FORD FOUNDATION", "POL-UNAIDS"], "award_id": "00059094", "output_descr": "HIV and sexual diversity: In the Arab region, most of the behaviours characterizing MARPs are criminalized (IDU, CSW, MSM, etc).

The team will continue working with legislators & parliamentarians in order to promote non-discriminatory laws on the national level, while following-up with regional counterparts (League of Arab States and Arab Parliament) to lobby and provide technical support towards the adoption of an Arab Convention promoting and protecting the rights of PLWH. Practices associated to MSM are legally condemned and widely stigmatized throughout the region. In addition to discriminating MSM and violating their human rights, this contributes to pushing them underground and prevents them from accessing HIV services (prevention, testing, care, treatment, support). Building on 3 expert consultations on Sexual diversity which gave birth to a Provisional Consensus (\"Red Sea Consensus\"), the team plans to conduct another consultation with HR experts/legislators to finalize the draft strategy on how to dispel stigma against MSM and ensure that they have access to HIV services, and to organize a regional colloquium in order to reach a general consensus and build a critical mass of leaders willing to tackle this issue.", "donor_short": [], "expenditure": [198131.0], "crs_descr": "Social mitigation of HIV/AIDS", "focus_area_descr": "-"}, {"output_id": "00073776", "crs": "13040", "donor_id": [""], "focus_area": "-", "gender_descr": "None", "output_title": "Arab St. (HIV Cross-cutting)", "budget": [217638.0], "fiscal_year": [2011], "gender_id": "0", "donor_name": ["POL-UNAIDS"], "award_id": "00059094", "output_descr": "Monitoring and Evaluation, as well as administrative costs", "donor_short": [], "expenditure": [227645.0], "crs_descr": "STD control including HIV/AIDS", "focus_area_descr": "-"}, {"output_id": "00073777", "crs": "13040", "donor_id": [""], "focus_area": "-", "gender_descr": "None", "output_title": "Arab St. (HIV Staff)", "budget": [228117.0], "fiscal_year": [2011], "gender_id": "0", "donor_name": ["POL-UNAIDS"], "award_id": "00059094", "output_descr": "Programme management support for salaries and related costs", "donor_short": [], "expenditure": [203259.0], "crs_descr": "STD control including HIV/AIDS", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00073773", "output_locID": "00073773-1", "name": "Global", "focus_area": "1", "lat": "", "type": "", "awardID": "00059094", "lon": "", "precision": "", "focus_area_descr": "Inclusive & Sustainable Growth"}], "operating_unit": "Bureau for Dev.
