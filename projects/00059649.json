The environmental and social baseline situation in the MUMAs along Suriname's west coast will be reviewed in a general manner, as well as the actual implementation of management. This will be important to bring the rationale and urgency for protection in sharper focus, as well as any shortcomings in the management of these MUMAs. The financial and administrative aspects of MUMA management will be reviewed next, including their shortcomings. Finally, PPG funds will be used to develop a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) strategy to track the project's impacts and to measure biodiversity conservation and financial performance trends over the long term. Based on these results the GEF project proposal will be developed. The project must be designed to satisfy critical needs and bridge critical gaps identified during the Project Preparation phase.", "donor_short": [], "expenditure": [32989.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [], "operating_unit": "Suriname", "budget": 39778.0, "iati_op_id": "SR", "inst_descr": "Physical plan Land  and forest", "start": "2010-03-29", "operating_unit_id": "SUR", "expenditure": 32989.0, "document_name": [[], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/SUR/00059649/PIMS 4370_BD_PPG_IP_Draft_Suriname_Coastal_PA_Mgmt_09Apr10.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/SUR/00059649/signed cover page Initiation plan Suriname Coastal protected areas management.pdf"], ["format", "format"]], "project_id": "00059649", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://undpsuriname.org/", "project_title": "suriname coastal protected area management prep grant"}
