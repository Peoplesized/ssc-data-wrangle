Each component is described brieflyin the joint programme, together with a list of indicative activities.  These are intended to serve as frameworks, recognizing that local-level activities may vary depending on the local needs and context.\r\n\r\nThe UN Joint Programme on Most-at-Risk Populations will be implemented in areas which register the highest number of new HIV infections: Metro Manila (Cities of Quezon, Makati, Manila and Pasay), Metro Cebu (Cities of Cebu, Mandaue and Lapu-lapu) and Davao City.  It will address the key barriers to the country's achieving its MDG and universal access targets.
