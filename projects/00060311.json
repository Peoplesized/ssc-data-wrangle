LEP programme is predicated on the Access to Justice Pillar of the UNCLEP framework and seeks improvements on both the supply side (duty bearers) and the demand side (right holders) toward strengthening the rule of law in Pakistan. On the supply-side the Programme will work with the police, judiciary, prosecution, prisons, and Ombudsman offices, while on the demand side it will work with civil society organizations and local communities to strengthen access to justice for poor and vulnerable citizens. The Program is slated to work in 36 districts across all 4 provinces and the GB region for enhancing legal awareness, providing legal aid, and building public trust in justice sector institutions. On the supply-side, provincial and national level interventions will include policy engagement, capacity building, infrastructure support and research and advocacy in collaboration with justice sector stakeholders.", "donor_short": ["UNDP", "UNDP(JPAA)"], "expenditure": [488140.0, 900179.0, 356169.0], "crs_descr": "Legal and judicial development", "focus_area_descr": "Democratic Governance"}, {"output_id": "00075887", "crs": "15130", "donor_id": ["10714", "00012"], "focus_area": "2", "gender_descr": "Gender Equality", "output_title": "Legal Empowerment of Poor-Biz", "budget": [198886.0, 258473.0, 210503.0], "fiscal_year": [2011, 2012, 2013], "gender_id": "1", "donor_name": ["Voluntary Contributions", "UNDP AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FOR A JOINT PROGRAMME PASS THROUGH ARRANGEMENT"], "award_id": "00060311", "output_descr": "The project seeks to enhance legal awareness of poor men and women from disadvantaged groups.
