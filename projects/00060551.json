A revised Flash Appeal (Pakistan Flood Relief & Early Recovery Response Plan) worth US$1.96 billion was launched by the IASC system. The relief response was concluded subsequent to the decision of Government of Pakistan to put an end to the relief activities by the end of January 2011. The UN system and the government agreed to launch Early Recovery Working Group to coordinate early recovery efforts after the end of relief phase. The ERWG was launched under the joint leadership of UNDP and National Disaster Management Authority.
