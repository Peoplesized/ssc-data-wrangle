This strategy needs to take into account the specific inter-ethnic and religious issues in Crimea, and the particular needs of formerly deported people, including resettlement and land questions, taking into account the \"draft law on the restoration of rights of persons deported on ethnic grounds\". Such a strategy would necessarily need to include a financial decentralization strategy (linked to wider local governance/decentralization discussions in Ukraine).", "donor_short": [], "expenditure": [7808.0], "crs_descr": "Government administration", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [], "operating_unit": "Ukraine", "budget": 7858.0, "iati_op_id": "UA", "inst_descr": "UNDP", "start": "2010-10-01", "operating_unit_id": "UKR", "expenditure": 7808.0, "document_name": [[], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/UKR/00060680/Project Document.pdf"], ["format"]], "project_id": "00060680", "inst_type_id": "40", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.undp.org.ua/", "project_title": "human security monitoring and public dialog in arc"}
