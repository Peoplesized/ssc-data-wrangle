The project is implemented through three phases:\r\n\r\nUnder Phase 1, project engaged in preparation of Human Development Course, beginning with a brainstorming meeting organized (as preliminary \"situation analysis\") to discuss opportunities and challenges for human development teaching in Azerbaijan, to identify priority human development topics, and to generate ideas for project activities. Project staff established contacts with a number of higher education establishments, as well as the Administration of President, Ministry of Education and other appropriate organizations for introducing and expanding Human Development teaching in local Universities. UNDP reached agreement with the Academy of Public Administration under the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan (APA) on piloting Human Development Course. The project also developed curriculum and prepared reading materials -- based on the resources from other UNDP offices engaged in human development teaching, -- for the pilot Human Development Course at APA.\r\n\r\nUnder Phase 2, the project piloted the \"Human Development\" Course at APA as a semester-long class. The course content, aside from basic introduction to human development concept and its measurements, included cross-sectoral review and in-depth study of the concept, how it applies in everyday life, and how it is (can be) reflected in public policies in Azerbaijan. Student assessments were conducted through \"knowledge generation\": aside from the regular assessment of academic performance, all students were required to develop \"case studies\" on different policy areas with linkages to human development and, as appropriate, formulate relevant policy recommendations through the prism of HD concept.\r\n\r\nUnder Phase 3, the project built on the lessons-learned of the pilot course and catered a refined curriculum and teaching package to other universities. Project reached partnership agreement with three universities to include Human Development Course into their official curriculum and identified a corpus of lead teachers for the Course. Another milestone was UNDP's administering a teacher training workshop for Human Development teachers to equip them with the refined curriculum, reading materials and teaching skills to effectively deliver the human development concept to current and future public officials, attending the partnering universities.", "donor_short": [], "expenditure": [63424.0], "crs_descr": "Government administration", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00081710", "output_locID": "00081710-1", "name": "Baku", "focus_area": "7", "lat": "40.377670", "type": "PPLC", "awardID": "00060695", "lon": "49.892010", "precision": "1", "focus_area_descr": "Development Impact & Effectiveness"}, {"outputID": "00081710", "output_locID": "00081710-2", "name": "Baku", "focus_area": "7", "lat": "40.377670", "type": "PPLC", "awardID": "00060695", "lon": "49.892010", "precision": "1", "focus_area_descr": "Development Impact & Effectiveness"}], "operating_unit": "Azerbaijan", "budget": 361029.0, "iati_op_id": "AZ", "inst_descr": "GOVERNMENT", "start": "2010-10-01", "operating_unit_id": "AZE", "expenditure": 292890.0, "document_name": [["00060695_AZ_UNDP_HD_Concept_Pro_Doc_2011", "00060695_AZ_UNDP__HD_Concept_Initiation_plan_2010", "00060695_Training of Trainers HDC"], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/AZE/00060695_AZ_UNDP_HD_Concept_Pro_Doc_2011.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/AZE/00060695_AZ_UNDP__HD_Concept_Initiation_plan_2010.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/AZE/00060695_Training of Trainers HDC.JPG"], ["pdf", "pdf", "format"]], "project_id": "00060695", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.az.undp.org/", "project_title": "human development course"}
