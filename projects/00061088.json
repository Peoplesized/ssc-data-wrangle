National Technology Action Plans (TAPs) agreed by all stakeholders at the country level will be prepared consistent with both the domestic and global objectives.   Each TAP, which will outline essential elements of an enabling framework for technology transfer consisting of market development, institutional, regulatory and financial measures, and human and institutional capacity development requirements, will also include a detailed plan of action to implement the proposed policy measures and estimate the need for external assistance to cover additional implementation costs.  Targeted training and supporting materials related to methodology for prioritization of technologies, market assessment, access and links to data on technologies will be developed and tested and made available to all participant countries.", "donor_short": ["UNEPRISO"], "expenditure": [12354.0, 104083.0, -54.0], "crs_descr": "Environmental policy and administrative management", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00077227", "output_locID": "00077227-1", "name": "Lebanon", "focus_area": "1", "lat": "33.833330", "type": "PCLI", "awardID": "00061088", "lon": "35.833330", "precision": "1", "focus_area_descr": "Inclusive & Sustainable Growth"}, {"outputID": "00078921", "output_locID": "00078921-1", "name": "Lebanon", "focus_area": "5", "lat": "33.88894", "type": "PCL", "awardID": "00061088", "lon": "35.49442", "precision": "9", "focus_area_descr": "Climate Change & Disaster Resilience"}], "operating_unit": "Lebanon", "budget": 609323.0, "iati_op_id": "LB", "inst_descr": "Ministry Of Environment", "start": "2011-06-01", "operating_unit_id": "LBN", "expenditure": 378769.0, "document_name": [["00061088_00077227 TNC Project Documents", "00061088_00078921 TNA Project Documents"], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/LBN/00061088_00077227 TNC Project Documents.pdf", "http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/LBN/00061088_00078921 TNA Project Documents.pdf"], ["pdf", "pdf"]], "project_id": "00061088", "inst_type_id": "10", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.lb.undp.org/", "project_title": "preparation to thethird national communication to unfccc"}
