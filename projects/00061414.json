Integral to the UNDPs challenge of building technical and institutional capacity within the Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS), is a need to ensure knowledge, resources and commitment are being sufficiently fostered by government institutions, such as the Ministry of Environment, to ensure appropriate action is taken towards protecting and enhancing Southern Sudan's natural environment. \n\nThe important role the environment plays towards mitigating conflict, sustaining livelihoods and delivering sustainable development is recognised by the Government of Southern Sudan through the GoSS Priority Core Function dedicated to natural resources management, with implications on environmental conservation and sustainable energy governance. In collaboration with other UN agencies and partners, UNDP Southern Sudan intends to provide support to the GoSS, by enhancing GoSS capacity to make informed decisions on protecting and enhancing the environment for current and future generations.\n\nThe purpose of this Project Initiation Plan (PIP) is therefore to begin the very first steps towards having a sector-wide intervention in the environment and sustainable energy areas within the GoSS Priority Areas on Natural Resource Management, and UNDP intended CPAP results. Hence, this PIP will set the stage for developing new interventions in environment and sustainable energy portfolios of projects, and support consolidation of existing projects, while promoting stakeholder networks and partnerships for contributing to the \"GoSS Priority Core Governance Functions\" on Natural Resource Management.\n\nThe expected result of the PIP is: \n\u2022\tAssessment conducted and report produced identifying environmental impacts, risks and opportunities; \n\u2022\tProposals of Pilot projects addressing targeted thematic areas (Climate Change and Natural Resources Management) produced with all its elements and components agreed by stakeholders and project partners.", "donor_short": ["UNDP"], "expenditure": [-625.0], "crs_descr": "Sectors Not Specified", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "subnational": [{"outputID": "00077785", "output_locID": "00077785-1", "name": "South Sudan", "focus_area": "-", "lat": "7.5", "type": "PCL", "awardID": "00061414", "lon": "30", "precision": "9", "focus_area_descr": "-"}], "operating_unit": "South Sudan, Republic of", "budget": 0.0, "iati_op_id": "SS", "inst_descr": "UNDP (Direct Execution)", "start": "2011-03-01", "operating_unit_id": "SSD", "expenditure": -625.0, "document_name": [[], ["http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/SSD/00061414/Environment and Sust Energy PIP.pdf"], ["format"]], "project_id": "00061414", "inst_type_id": "40", "operating_unit_website": "http://www.ss.undp.org/", "project_title": "environment and sustainable energy capacity dev."}
