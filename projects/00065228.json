Each AT-mine is guarded by 3 APs. In addition, reinforcement minefields, also with bounding fragmentation mines, have been laid randomly and scattered along the whole NBP without proper recording, complicating the clearance/verification implementation significantly.\n\nThe National Committee for Demining and Rehabilitation (NCDR) tasked Norwegian People's Aid (NPA) to undertake the project after they successfully completed the Southern Border/Wadi Araba project.
